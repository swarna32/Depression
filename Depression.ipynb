that will read this and hit me with some world altering advice because there is absolutely no way in hell will ever tell anyone especially not doctor or psychiatrist what you are about to read but really just need to get this out there first and foremost no im not going to kill myself let get that out of the way but do think im depressed wa telling myself it wa just life slump for long time then wa telling myself it wa just sadness from the slump now ve literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like year and got ta talk about it with someone even if someone is this phone screen ve always had major self esteem and confidence issue not really sure what it stem from but have always felt inferior to those around me which btw can not believe people live life happy with their appearance that is blessing that people take for granted anyways ive done some research and educated myself with the science behind depression and believe that over the past few year mix of rapid lifestyle change and stress related event ha caused me to have depression the part that confuses me is that while my life is on the more stressful and busy side of thing don feel like it a bad life to live have wonderful friend family have great scholarship to good school do fun thing and go to party and drink feel like an average person put in my shoe would be happy and excel if they had any drive or passion at all which do not probably why fuck everything up all the time it is common for me to have suicidal thought really don know why since in reality wouldn want to kill myself may be piece of shit but im not selfish nor do like the pain of self harm am self aware of these thought and have attempted breathing and thought altering method to get rid of them but they pierce my heart and mind like dagger it physically hurt they are not always about suicide but they are always very negative targeted at myself just can help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing had the nut to finally end it all sometimes can look at myself in the mirror because know it ll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me and sad it is to say it really just do not like myself look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly am objectively and on paper am not the worst looking guy im and im physically fit but holy shit swear what see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different there have been few instance in recent month of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or have nice body and take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but just can i literally can i don see it don know where you guy are looking but truly don see what you see okay it not just about my appearance find myself annoying and awkward try to be happy go lucky guy most of the time usually bringing conversation and smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes but behind my smile is most commonly frown im fucking annoying my thought scream at me at how what just said is so stupid and need to shut the fuck up why do talk so much why would ask that ect talk too much sometimes say thing dont even mean or agree with just to say something never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me lot im volatile and irritable and ugh fuck up most thing do work school relationship you know how it go the classic poor me self pity ruin everything type shpeal something about the way wa made is just wrong guess that another one of those negative thought that repeat in my head lot born wrong today had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself beating my own face in felt great honestly wish could ve made it reality can find happiness in any of the thing used to enjoy ive gradually stopped all my hobby except for the gym which is where take my anger out usually have lot of that can even sit through movie without thinking what is the point of me doing this what is the point life feel numb pointless go about my societal life just like everybody else study work play sleep rarely but it all feel the same gray bland mesh of nothing even something like eating delicious food just don get enjoyment anymore the best way can explain how feel is if im with people and someone make joke that people laugh at of course laugh but if nobody else laughed would never know when to laugh honest opinion of myself fucking suck im lazy and lie all the time to keep up persona of not being sad downer hater fuck constantly make poor decision and can seem to learn from previous one im ugly the only thing im good at are mansplaining and making fool of myself say dumb shit and get shit on for it what kind of asshole ha the privilege and opportunity that have and is still sad and lazy like this im the type of person that wa actually just wired wrong in the head and the fact that try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can disgust me to be honest don even know who am few month ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is replied nothing don have one really don have talent or something im good at and seeing people around me do amazing thing and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurt do not feel like this id say about of the time forget about all my stress and worry and appearance and fuck ups and im actually happy then when the happy go away realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all come flooding back im just running around my mess of life chasing those euphoric mindless high and happiness that seem to get weaker and shorter each time find them the question find myself asking often is why why am doing this why do feel this way why did say that why did do that why am a certain way yadda yadda am realist also truly believe there is no point to this life why do we all live such stressful unrewarding life putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever read comment on post like these saying that life is beautiful meet everyone you can experience nature get help it get better it can get better but the thing is no it can everyone situation is different guess but where im at and what im doing nothing gon na change im not going anywhere even if wa it wouldn matter societal standing and fancy job position mean nothing

red hot meditated and focused on my breathing but d retreat back into my head between each breath and be left gasping for air took scalding bath for moment wa in my skin again but then the water and felt one tried to nap reset wa always in store but woke up still at death door hadn done it yet though d never been closer but still hadn done it before hit send before decorated the door told myself d go for one last run to get out of my head ve been treading water the last week just barely keeping my head up tried mushroom few day ago and for the first time in what felt like month could accept myself in fact discovered wa stuck in time two month earlier when d been dumped my heart hadn moved on but the universe relentlessly had and for hour the mushroom gave me clarity that needed to move on and even had there wa moment when time seemed to stop and suddenly wa vaulted forward to the present over and around the intervening month wa present again but just sudden the revelation had fallen upon me it wa stripped away and the black dog weighed down my chest once more shakily put on my running clothes considered my route an old standard roughly mile it buy me calculated more minute to think about this decision cinched my lace hate these shoe struck out the door when my foot hit the pavement realized this wasn a regular jog wasn running to run wa running to kill myself or not d find out along the way suddenly the route and distance didn matter knew d be going further than d thought started out at normal pace and began upping my tempo knew wa out of shape knew single minute mile would be my limit it had been on several of the past day but today wasn those day couldn feel the exhaustion the pain of my body moment earlier all could feel wa my body exhausted wa trapped in my head could push my body well past it limit today because wasn leaving my heart or my head until my body hurt more around the first mile started muttering to myself you ve never outrun yourself before but today is the day you beat yourself and kept running came upon long flat stretch narrow catwalk along the water edge and broke into sprint wa going to break myself now pushed until could feel the burn in my leg my throat and my lung hadn pushed myself like this in day week month or maybe even year d forgotten what it felt like started feeling light headed this wa to be alive but it couldn last ground to halt and walked finally outside my head again but still thinking finally not drowning in my thought d realized earlier what it is in those last moment it is quite literally drowning in your

diverted suddenly my breathing reflex kick in haven been breathing ve been drowning in my thought and with it sense of fear and dread adrenaline course through my aorta spreading across my chest and

on project or spoke to my mom but to do so d have to get through those long dark minute of pure and intense pain d have to learn to hurt myself again running hiking biking but kept running fast and

              " 'i feel so sad and lonely so am student at university now am an international student and came to this country last year am kind of shy and always chose to keep the feeling to myself than speak out there wa one girl in my class that liked she wa smart and intelligent rather than anything romantic thought we could be friend but did not approach her till the end of the semester on one of the final day wa like can always be scared to express so went upto her and asked her contact detail we talked bit and she asked if wan na go for movie we went the next week and it wa fun it wa good to have friend in foreign country we went out few time after that well then she had covid and tried to give her some advice and said that wa stifling her even though had just told her to take care of herself the next day she said that she ha issue that she need to sort out and want space being friend didn understand what issue or what did do but did not message her week later she message me back in good mood and say that let watch something and we watch movie at her home cook for her at her place and think she enjoyed well she doe some painting and showed me those so asked are these just for you and then she said that she shared it on instagram by her pseudonym and feel good when her internet friend appreciate it did not read too much into what internet friend meant day later wa scrolling through instagram when it occurred to me to look her painting up so searched her pseudonym and found that it wa public profile and saw that she had posted painting like it so messaged her on whatsapp where we usually chatted that hey saw your painting and what liked about it something flipped her off and she said that her internet persona is different than the real life persona and what did wa big mistake and she doe not want to talk anymore wa like did not about this internet persona thing and you had said you shared it with your friend but if it is that big an issue am sorry and will not look at your painting and then she wa so rude she said that it wa the last chance she gave me but me explaining why looked wa too much did not respond anything i wa so hurt did not even do anything bad or something to intentionally hurt her did not message her anything for week did not look at her whatsapp just tried to forget her around day ago in moment of weakness searched her name and see that she ha blocked me on whatsapp didn even do anything after she said all that got very depressed and wrote her long message on text this wa the message hello please read this that is my only request yesterday had tried to message you on whatsapp asking how you were and saw that you have blocked me you can block me here and everywhere else well after this just want you to read what wa in my mind when we were talking from the day we had started talking do not know what all bad thing you think about me but atleast from my side had always wanted to be good friend and never had any bad thought had fun on each of our meeting have been continuously thinking for the last month what did do wrong you never told me and just shut me off maybe these were the reason don even know can even think properly thought that we were very alike honestly thought we could be good friend two introvert who want to be better at their craft and helping each other out through tough school again do not know what all notion you had about my intention but did not want to be more than friend if you ever felt that way am new guy in this country there are many thing have not even understood here having relationship or girlfriend is the last thing on my mind don even have friend here to share stuff so never wanted anything more than just being friend who could help each other whenever they needed or share thing about life course maybe take some advice on what to do in certain aspect of life thing that normal friend do and maybe wa selfish to have looked for that friend in you you had said that did not deserve to be friend the last time we talked there ha not been day when did not think what did do wrong that am not even worth friendship think that had probably messaged you more than what you wanted a friend don know you never told me that thought everything wa normal whenever something came to my mind or watched some video that liked on youtube used to send it to you think should not have done that and maybe you didn like that just did that because wanted to share thing with you that admired so that those thing may bring happiness to you well the other reason wa that looked at your painting on instagram am sorry that looked at your instagram profile to appreciate your painting did not have any wrong intention wa just curious and had thought you would like it you had said that you like it when your friend appreciate your art wa not aware of internet persona being different from real life persona am not bad person just wanted to be friend and someone you could trust am not writing this to you for any response or for being friend because don think have any respect in your eye and have lost much of my self respect in my own eye after how many time have tried to apologize honestly for last week didn even look for you on whatsapp it wa soul crushing to read how you had said that blew the chance of being friend and think it is best that you do not respond to me i can not feel more pathetic and worse about myself trying to mend the bridge which never even existed just want to say that am sorry if ever hurt you or made you feel bad always wanted to be good and make you happy a friend never had any malice or any bad intention never wanted to be someone who you despise this much am just sorry and will be really grateful if you could just let me know what did texted her this and and then she texted back don say if own up to your mistake and now she will block me in text well am not even sure what did and feel depressed lonely and sad have never felt like this',\n",

family the one organization in my college that m extremely involved with ha cut tie with me over accusation that are not true have leadership role in this organization and being leader in the organization with no prior experience ha brought me ton of hater and people that just want to see my downfall literally have no future i supposed to graduate this semester and get job but am nowhere near both can pursue my real passion and to top it all of and what really might put me over the edge is problem with this woman in my life we met through this organization that wa talking about earlier in this text a captain have my own committee of people that oversee and she wa one of my committee member the first time we hung out in october she took me out to bar after turned it wa just me and her we quickly started to develop this really cool friendship where we hangout and talk almost daily a young man hopeless in love started to develop feeling but nothing crazy because almost always saw her a best friend first and m sure she felt the same way then we were at bar about month ago she wa talking to some guy at the bar and wa having funny conversation with my friend but could see from the corner of my eye that she wa talking to this man and that when first started feeling these feeling of jealousy but could tell she wa looking at me too talking to my friend and she came to me and we embraced and hugged her almost all night had my arm around her and everything and she had her hand over mine too and we just kept feeling each other this wa the first time we ever moved into this phase of our friendship and think we both felt something brewing in our heart for one another few day went by and wa out yet again talking to this other chick met at the bar and we ended up almost hooking up back at my place but couldn go through with it because all could think about wa my best friend who really liked m an introvert at heart and will always keep my feeling inside because m scared to tell people how feel and suppress those feeling but literally the next day after this hookup that didn happen wa at friend st birthday party and got hammered myself and had this urge of wanting to tell my best friend how truly felt about her and that exactly what did it wa thursday night she always go to this one specific club on thursday night so ditched my friend and went to that club to see her and it literally played out like romantic film she wa the first person saw when walked in and went up to her and for the first time in my life poured my heart out to her and told her how felt about her and how she make me feel and at first she wa shocked and then she said she felt the same way and we kissed for long time at this moment wa on cloud had never had girlfriend before had never been in relationship before but in this moment it wa just me and her against the world and loved it we started to head back to my apartment but the alcohol wa kicking in for me and passed out once got back to my apartment woke up the next day and saw her heel on the floor but she wa nowhere to be found so texted her and told her that wa sorry for passing out from the alcohol but meant every word told her last night she didn text me back till later that day and she said that she wa thinking about it all day and night and she didn want to fuck up our friendship it one of the few good thing in her life right now and totally get that wa disappointed hearing this yeah of course wa but texted her back saying that we can talk about this in person another time but for right now enjoy your weekend the next day we saw each other at party and talked to her outside and told her that d rather say we tried to make it work and it didn rather than not giving a chance at all and she never gave me clear answer she texted me later that night saying that she needed break and some time to think so said okay few day later we had our last committee meeting and it wa so awkward cause we hadn talked before and we were on this so called break and after the meeting ended she immediately left even though she usually wait for me got text from her later that night around am saying that this letter wrote for everyone on my committee wa very sweet and cute and asked her how long this break should last and she said she wasn sure she didn want me to think that she wa leading me on which thought she wa doing so we hopped on this facetime call and had really nice long conversation about all the stuff we had to catch up on and then after an hour switched the topic back to our relationship and she basically said that she didn feel the same way wa so hurt when she said this because all the sign pointed to her liking me too and really felt like knew what her heart wa saying we both went to sleep cry that night for each other the next day sent her text this time saying that do need some space to figure thing out and we can talk after spring break so for the next week we didn talk she didn view my story like any of my social medium post and just simply didn communicate with each other and it wa one of the worst thing for me to go through she wa someone really looked forward to talking to and to not be able to do that just sucked the sunday before we came back to college texted her and asked if she be down to hangout that first week we got back and she said she wa down to do so and wa so happy because it felt like wa getting my friend back again but then few day later she angrily text me asking if told anyone that we hooked up which isn true and told her that didn which is true there were rumor going around about from people that saw hangout lot that saw embrace at the bar that saw kiss at the club and saw walk back to my apartment together so people could only assume that we were thing and kept telling her that but she wasn having it she facetimed me saying that she regretted ever kissing me she didn want to be friend anymore and all this shit wa extremely hurt hearing this and just wanted my friend back and wanted to forget ever opening up my feeling for her so sent her really long text explaining that never said anything that really cared about her and just wanted my best friend back she responded by saying that she appreciated me reaching out and that she wa over the situation and that she not ready to move forward with me and doesn think our friendship will ever be the same so texted her this morning and said get it and if there wa any way we could meet in person and just talk she responded back by saying that she potentially open to it but not now maybe next week so said just genuinely need someone to talk to but understand her the last text she sent me wa don think can be that person for you anymore m sorry am heartbroken devastated and hopeless angry at myself angry at this world and just want to leave have no direction in life no one to turn to anymore and just want to end it all soon possible',\n",

to attend college on an rotc scholarship about month ago prior to that wa deployed to afghanistan for about month it almost hard to even recall the person used to be back then wa so mentally strong and confident in myself and my purpose ironically despite working hour day seven day week under constant threat of getting blown up can remember time when wa better off mentally like nothing in the world could stop me i had plan and wa going to stick with it and if did end up getting murked wa just fine with that too stayed pretty safe for the most part although did have pretty close call with rocket that landed in ditch on the hill below the building worked in it obviously scared the ever living fuck out of me and everyone else but after like minute we were all laughing about how close that one wa and how if only the stupid guy had aimed higher he would have got the whole affair really only strengthened my resolve and made the return home that much better getting back to the state wa probably the best moment of my life even if it wa right in the middle of covid lol don want to sound like m trying to flex my great strength or anything m just trying to describe who wa then to who am now they aren even remotely the same person problem started to arise for me around month after getting back after the novelty of being back home wore off started to experience this weird sense of dissociation and depressive episode that would sometimes last for an hour to day and then would suddenly snap back to what considered normal state of mind these normally entailed feeling of hopelessness and dread like something in my head just wasn ticking right and when it came to social situation it wa like wa operating on different frequency than everyone else like could hear and understand them but there wa no emotion behind the word it wa distracting but manageable at that point and just chalked it up to being burned out at work and figured once got off active duty and into college thing would greatly improve fast forward to the first semester of college and unfortunately thing have not gone i imagined in term of school and finance m doing fine and everything is going according to plan externally but internally seem to be slowly degrading bit by bit the depressive episode became more intense to the point where would physically lock up tighten my muscle grind my teeth and it feel like my head is throbbing from all the negative thought it is nearly impossible to sleep in this state thanks to the extreme anxiety but then would wake up the next morning and feel fine barely being able to remember how felt the night before the cycle never stopped though and then the thought of well if you just ended it this wouldn be problem anymore started to kick in and that when it really started to snowball downhill fast at this point in time it feel like m in this depressive state nearly all the time it only matter of how bad it going to be today the dissociative feeling have been cranked up to and conversation just feel like emotionless formality can no longer connect with friend and family the way used to like said earlier it like we re not on the same frequency if that make any sense the thought of suicide are ever present and feel like big red emergency eject button begging to be pressed the only escape from these feeling are partying drug and alcohol which are great temporarily but eventually everyone go back to their life you sober up and reality slap you in the face even harder than it did last time ve also developed very odd fear of human intimacy that really can explain for instance m virgin which is huge insecurity of mine and pretty embarrassing know always figured when m in college ll meet plenty of woman so there no need to be insecure about it however ve had several instance where woman have come onto me and m totally comfortable with the conversation and flirty talk but once it get physical even just them grabbing me it trigger this instant fear and panic response and make up an excuse and leave in manic state then beat myself up for the next week about how much of pussy am this is honestly one of the major contributor to my broken self image couple of week ago randomly started bawling in my car for over an hour and honestly don even remember why m not eating much anymore maybe only like one meal day and my cognitive performance motivation ha declined significantly my sleep schedule is total mess ll either sleep for hour and wake up from nightmare in cold sweat or sleep for and not want to get out of bed and face reality what really prompted me to post this though wa that last week got really drunk and ended up putting gun to my head without even thinking about it and then realized what wa doing that when kind of told myself holy shit man this is real and something is very wrong with you need some kind of help know but if m diagnosed with any kind of mental health condition ll lose my scholarship and ve just worked too damn hard for it ve openly told some of my close friend and family directly that m having suicidal thought but the response is always oh mon man your way too strong

throughout the day knowing there won be message from them anymore haven accepted that it is over they were my first for everything it hard right now because m not working and sometimes get week break from school ve had free time before but haven had free time without speaking to them constantly in year so feel super lonely and don know what to do most of the day spend in bed wa diagnosed with depression about week ago have probably eaten le than calorie day for the past week which is just making the depression worse because there no fuel in the tank sometimes le than that because have no desire to eat just feel nauseous wa doing better somewhat until decided to reach out to this person to confirm whether or not we could contact each other again and thinking we could possibly be friend in the future got message from this person about week ago stating that it wa completely over far ever communicating with each other again and also my dog died so lost the two thing cared about the most all in the span of month and long story short harassed that person because wanted them to talk to me wanted to say goodbye properly and wanted them to say goodbye properly because it didn end well and wanted to fix it have always tried to fix thing and be perfect and never make mistake just wanted to fix it definitely made it way worse by spamming them didn mean to have always tried to be good person and do the right thing and treat people the right way and now don know who am anymore feel really really bad about it would never actually do anything to hurt this person this person knew me more than anyone in my life ever ha really didn understand that what wa doing wa harassment thought if messaged them enough they would understand me and talk to me but that wa not the case tried to message them on multiple different platform and begged for them to speak to me most of the time sent the message wa in the middle of one of my panic attack or cry on the floor and sometimes would try to reach out super late at night when the depression get the worse would like to add that ve never experienced heartbreak before and ve never had anything this bad happen to me my mom car accident affected me year ago but this wa different kind of pain even sent them money through money transfer app just so could send message because wa blocked on everything else know that m not okay but don know what to do or how to fix it it worth noting that this person life very very far away so when the relationship ended knew d never see or hear from them again and couldn handle not having this person in my life we had talked messaged each other every single day for year and we had traveled to different place together over the last year my life ha always involved this person don know who am without them the only time m not in pain is when m sleeping and even then have dream about them but we are still together in those dream so when wake up the realization is brutal thought they were my soulmate and that we would be together forever and grow old together one day think it hard because remember promising to always be with each other and have each other to love each other forever think could maybe deal with the relationship ending but can let go of the promise we made and when remember this person isn in my life anymore it make me physically sick sometimes get actual chest pain m and don think m capable of loving someone else ever again knew this person wa special from the moment meant them hesitated to ask them out because knew there wa possibility that relationship could end and never wanted to have this person out of my life wanted them to always be my friend and didn want relationship to possibly ruin that it did in the end anyways lost my best friend not talking to them every day feel like part of me is gone missing it doesn feel right that we re not together anymore it feel like they died it feel like the universe isn going right like it not in alignment and this wasn suppose to happen don think that we aren suppose to be together it feel wrong they were suppose to come visit soon but now it never going to happen had already practiced how wa going to show them how the shower work because everyone work differently bought spare soap moved thing out of my room so it would be quieter at night for them planned the place we were going to go and thing we were going to do imagined going to get food and sit in the car and talk how wa going to show them new thing and comfort them during the long car drive the movie we were going to watch etc it not happening anymore now can do any of those thing without breaking down how do let this go and definitely can never get on another plane again because ve only ever been on plane to see them wa at my happiest when

issue she cheated on me at the beginning of the relationship and later found out stayed with her and then cheated on her it wa this weird situation because we both wronged each other so we saw it we re equal let try to make this work though our relationship could be considered rocky at best still loved her very much and had never felt such strong emotion for someone like that before she wa my first real girlfriend she introduced me to her family and vice versa we went on vacation with each other we went to punk show and enjoyed music because we had similar taste in music around december she caught me flirting with girl on my phone and guess you can say she ended the relationship but everything wa still the same we would see each other regularly have sex pretty regularly go out and do thing with one other and talk all the time like we did it wa almost like we never even broke but she said the relationship wa over but if prove to her that would make change that we would get back together at first wa super apologetic and begged her for forgiveness but soon realized that everything wa still the same minus the fact that we technically aren in relationship anymore did lot of soul searching and talking to those around me who told me it wa for the best that we didn date anymore so started talking to other girl around this time meet my guitar teacher and started playing the guitar ve been playing for about month now it something that make me very happy and enjoy doing it like mentioned earlier with my ex everything felt the same except we technically weren in relationship but she would still say she love and care about me in december wa still trying to get her forgiveness she bought me these sick computer speaker bought her this ring with our name engraved on it but she didn really seem to like it and even left it at my house and never took it even though that what she wa begging me to buy for her at one point told her that it bothered me that she completely just tossed away the ring and her response is why would wear promise ring when ve broken the promise didn have rebuttal to it so dropped the subject january rolled around and the idea of trying to gain her favor back and earning our relationship back grew to disdain we both were on bumble tinder talking to other people flirting but we still would be in this weird situation where we were in this relationship saying love you to each other so like mentioned earlier had downloaded dating apps and met flirted with some girl and she wa doing the same thing but told her that m growing tired of this weird thing and that want to be back with her and try to make thing work and she wa kinda blowing it off deleted all the dating apps wasn meeting flirting with any girl and didn do anything with anyone besides her this whole time so fast forward to my birthday on february st and she bought ticket for to go to knot berry farm amusement park here in socal we had good time and we ended up having sex later that night during this whole weird period we were having sex pretty consistently my birthday ended up being the last time we saw each for while because my best friend said that they saw her on bumble tinder made new account and saw her she swiped right on me both time and it set me off because kept telling her wanted to be with her and wanted to start over and she said wanted to well but wanted to make sure but wanted wait and that she loved me and only wanted to be with me would always say she can imagine being with anyone but me so seeing her on these apps even though we told each other we weren going to be on them anymore so sent her this long message telling her how felt about her our relationship and the whole tinder bumble situation and that wa through with her then it wa almost she flipped the script and that she wa the one begging me to get back with each other and she pulled her whole love you can imagine being with one else but you blah blah but
